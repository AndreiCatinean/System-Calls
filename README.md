# System-Calls

This repository encompasses three projects/assignments (named a1, a2, a3) I completed for the "Operating Systems" course using the C language. These assignments exclusively utilize system calls, avoiding higher-end functions, to implement programs focusing on concepts such as mutexes, locks, semaphores, multi-threading, and parallelization in C. Each assignment received a 10 grade from the evaluator.
